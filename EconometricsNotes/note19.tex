\section{Stochastic Block Model}

Consider an undirected graph $G$, with nodes $V$ and edges $E$. Let 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $n$ be a positive integer: the number of \textbf{vertices}
        \item $k$ be a positive integer: the number of \textbf{communities}
        \item $p=\left(p_1,\cdots,p_k\right)$ be a probability vector on $\left\{ 1,\cdots,k \right\} \coloneq [k]$: the \textbf{prior} on the $k$ communities
        \item $\mathbf{W}$ be a $k\times k$ symmetric matrix with entries $ W_{ij}\in [0,1]$: the matrix of \textbf{connectivity probabilities}
    \end{itemize}
then we have
\begin{definition}{Stochastic Block Model}{stoch_block_model}
    The pair $(\mathbf{X},G)$ is drawn under $SBM(n,p,\mathbf{W})$ if $\mathbf{X}$ is an $n$ dimensional random vector with i.i.d. components distributed under $p$, and $G$ is an $n-$vertex simple graph 
    where vertices $i$ and $j$ are connected with probability $W_{X_i,X_j}$, \myhl[myred]{\textbf{independently}} of other pairs of vertices. And the \textbf{community} sets can be defined by 
    \begin{equation*}
        \Omega_i = \Omega_i(\mathbf{X}) \coloneq \left\{ v\in [n]: X_v=i \right\}, i\in [k]
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
Immediately, we can define the symmetry of SBM as:
\begin{definition}{Symmetric SBM}{symmetric_sbm}
    An SBM is called symmetric if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p$ is \textbf{uniform}
        \item $\mathbf{W}$ takes the same value \textbf{on the diagonal} and the same value \textbf{off the diagonal} 
    \end{itemize}
    $(\mathbf{X},G)$ is drawn under $SSBM(n,k,A,B)$ if $p=\left\{ 1/k \right\}^k$ and $\mathbf{W}$ takes avlue $A$ on the diagonal and $B$ off the diagonal.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Recovery}
The goal of community detection is to recover the labels $\mathbf{X}$ by observing $G$, up to some level of accuracy. First, define \myhl[myred]{\textbf{agreement}} as 
\begin{definition}{Agreement of Communities}{community_agreement}
    The agreement between two community vectors $\mathbf{x,y}\in [k]^n$ is obtained by maximizing the common components between $\mathbf{x}$ and any relabelling of $\mathbf{y}$, that is 
    \begin{equation*}
        A(\mathbf{x,y}) = \max_{\pi\in S_k}\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}\mathbf{1}\left[x_i = \pi(y_i)\right]
    \end{equation*}
    where $S_k$ is the group of permutations on $[k]$.
\end{definition}
The \textbf{relabelling} permutation is used to handle symmetric communities such as in SSBM, as it is impossible to recover the actual labels in this case.
But it's possible to recover the \textbf{partition}. There are 2 types of partition recovery we consider 

\paragraph*{Exact Recovery} 
First, consider the case of \myhl[myred]{\textbf{exact recovery}}:
\begin{definition}{Exact Recovery}{exact_recovery}
   Let $(\mathbf{X},G)\sim SBM(n,p,W)$, the exact recovery is solved if there exists an algorithm that takes $G$ as an input and outpus $\hat{\mathbf{X}} = \hat{\mathbf{X}}(G)$ such that $\mathbb{P}\left\{ A(\mathbf{X},\hat{\mathbf{X}}) =1 \right\} = 1-o_p(1)$ 
\end{definition}
In the SSBM case, algorithms that guarantee $$A(\mathbf{X},\hat{\mathbf{X}}) \rightarrow \frac{1}{k}$$ would be trivial.

\paragraph*{Weak Recovery} 
On the other hand, we the case of \myhl[myred]{\textbf{weak recovery}} defined as 
\begin{definition}{Weak Recovery}{weak_recovery}
    Weak recovery or detection is solved $SSBM(n,k,A,B)$ if for $(\mathbf{X},G)\sim SSBM(n,k,A,B)$, then $\exists \epsilon >0 $ and an algorithm that takes $G$ as an input and outputs $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ such that 
    $$
    \mathbb{P}\left\{ A(\mathbf{X},\hat{\mathbf{X}})\geq \frac{1}{k} + \epsilon \right\} = 1-o(1)
    $$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Example: SSBM(n,2)}
Let's look at the example of $SSBM(n,2,\alpha\frac{\log n}{n},\beta \frac{\log n}{n})$, where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $n$: number of vertices (assumed to be even for simplicity)
    \item for each $v\in [n]$, a binary label $X_v$ is attached s.t. $$ \left\vert \left\{ v\in [n]: X_v =1 \right\} \right\vert = n/2 $$
    \item for each pair of distinct nodes $u,v\in[n]$, an edge is placed with probability $\alpha \frac{\log n}{n}$ if $X_u=X_v$, and $\beta\frac{\log n}{n}$ if $X_u \neq X_v $
\end{itemize}
