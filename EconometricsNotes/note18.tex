\section{Motivation}
Consider $n$ independent observations $\mathbf{X}_i\in \mathbb{R}^p$ drawn from a $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$, then the covariance can be decomposed into 2 parts, white noise and low rank
\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathrm{Cov}(\mathbf{X}_i) = \mathbf{I} + \sum^M_{k=1}\theta_k \nu_k\nu'_k =\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_0 + \boldsymbol{\Phi}
\end{align*}
where $M$ denotes the \myhl[myblue]{\textbf{number of spikes}} in the distribution of eigenvalues. The idea is: spikes deviate from a reference model along a \textbf{\underline{small fixed number}} of unknown directions. If $\boldsymbol{\Phi}=\mathbf{0}$, then none of the sample eigenvalues is separated from the bulk.

\paragraph*{Why a spike model is interesting?} A spike model can help determine the latent dimension of the data, some examples being
\begin{itemize}
    \item Principal component analysis (PCA): spikes are related to the directions of the most variations of the data, i.e., the principal components
    \item Clustering model: $M$ spikes is equivalent to $M+1$ clusters
    \item Economic significance: $M$ is related to the number of factor loadings
\end{itemize}

Then the question is threefold: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] How to determine $M$
    \item[-] How to estimate $\nu_k$
    \item[-] How to test $\theta_k$
\end{itemize}

Under rank one alternative, we would like to test
\begin{align*}
    H_0 &: \boldsymbol{\Sigma}= \mathbf{I}_p & H_1 &: \boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{I}_p+ \theta\boldsymbol{\nu}\boldsymbol{\nu}', \theta>0
\end{align*}
