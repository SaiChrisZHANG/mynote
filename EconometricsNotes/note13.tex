\lecture{13}{Non-convex Learning + Lasso}{}{Sai Zhang}{Combining the best of the two, we can use \textbf{Lasso plus Concave} method, with Lasso screening and concave component selecting variables, achieving a coordinated intrinsic two-scale learning.}{The note is built on Prof. \hyperlink{http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jinchi-lv/}{Jinchi Lv}'s lectures of the course at USC, DSO 607, High-Dimensional Statistics and Big Data Problems.}

We are facing a tradeoff:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \myhl[myblue]{\textbf{Convex}} methods: have appealing prediction power and oracle inequalities, but challenging to provide tight \underline{false sign rate control}
\end{itemize}
