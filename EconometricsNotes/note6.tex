\section{Panel Data Configurations}

\subsection{Data Types}
\subsubsection{Panel Data}
For observations on $N$ units, indexed by $i=1,\cdots,N$, over $T$ periods, indexed by $t=1,\cdots,T$, the outcome of interest is denoted by $Y_{it}$, the treatment $W_{it}$.
These observations may themselves consist of averages over more basic units:
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{Y} &= \begin{pmatrix}
        Y_{11} & \cdots & Y_{1T}\\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        Y_{N1} & \cdots & Y_{NT}
    \end{pmatrix} &
    \mathbf{W} = \begin{pmatrix}
        W_{11} & \cdots & W_{1T}\\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        W_{N1} & \cdots & W_{NT}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
we may also observe exogenous variables $X_{it}$ or $X_i$. Typically, we focus on a balanced panel where for all units $i=1,\cdots,N$ we observe outcomes for all $t=1,\cdots,T$.

\subsubsection{Grouped Repeated Cross-Section Data}
In a GRCS data, we have observations on $N$ units, each observed only once in period $T_i$ for unit $i$. Different units may be observed at diffrent points in time, $T_i$ typically takes on only a few values, with many units sharing the same value for $T_i$. The outcome $Y_i$ and treatment $W_i$ are indexed by the unit index $i$.
The set of units is \textbf{partitioned} into 2 or more groups, with the group that unit $i$ belongs to denoted by $G_i\in \mathcal{G}=\left\{1,2,\cdots,G\right\}$.

Define the average outcomes for each group-time-period pair:
\begin{equation*}
    \bar{Y}_{gt} \equiv \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} \mathbf{1}_{G_i=g,T_i=t}Y_i}{\sum^N_{i=1} \mathbf{1}_{G_i=g,T_i=t}}
\end{equation*}
for treatment 
\begin{equation*}
    \bar{W}_{gt} \equiv \frac{\sum^N_{i=1} \mathbf{1}_{G_i=g,T_i=t}W_i}{\sum^N_{i=1} \mathbf{1}_{G_i=g,T_i=t}}
\end{equation*}
then treat the $G\times T$ group averages $\bar{Y}_{gt}$ and $\bar{W}_{gt}$ as the unit of observation, then the grouped data is just a panel.
The major issue in practice is that the number of groups is very small comparing to proper panel data.

\subsubsection{Row and Column Exchangeable Data}
The data are doubly indexed by $i=1,\cdots,N$ and $j=1,\cdots,J$, with outcomes $Y_{ij}$. They are different from panel data in that there is \textbf{no time ordering} for the second index.
